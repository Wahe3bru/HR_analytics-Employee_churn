# HR_analytics-Employee_churn

This is an example of using Machine learning to predict employee churn.<br>
I go through the Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, showing some graphs and some of my thoughts.
I chose `DecisionTreeClassifier` algorithm as my model.
I then go through the steps of creating and training a model, as well as ways to improve the model.

the files:<br>
The [churn.ipynb](./churn.ipynb) goes through the steps of creating a model to predict employee churn.<br>
The [tree.dot](./tree.dot) file is the graph_export file, the contents of which can be used to visualise the Decision Tree on [webgraphviz](www.webgraphviz).<br>
Turnover.csv is an employee dataset I found at [Datacamp](www.datacamp.com), it contains 14999 rows with 10 columns.
